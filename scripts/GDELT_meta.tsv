ti_id	ti_globaleventid	time	globaleventid	EVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES	3	GlobalEventID	(integer) Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely identifies it in the master dataset. NOTE: While these will often be sequential with date, this is NOT always the case and this field should NOT be used to sort events by date: the date fields should be used for this. NOTE: There appear to be a very small number of records that received duplicate GLOBALEVENTID values due to an unknown error in the numbering subsystem early on. This did not affect the deduplication process, since that operates directly on the attribute fields themselves, but does appear to have led to some duplicate GlobalEventIDs. These appear to be randomly distributed and the duplicate events should be safe to discard or renumber.	np.int32
ti_d	ti_day	time	day	EVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES	4	Day	(integer) Date the event took place in YYYYMMDD format.	np.int32
ti_my	ti_monthyear	time	monthyear	EVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES	5	MonthYear	(integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYYMM format.	np.int32
ti_y	ti_year	time	year	EVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES	6	Year	(integer) Alternative formatting of the event date, in YYYY format.	np.int32
ti_f	ti_fractiondate	time	fractiondate	EVENTID AND DATE ATTRIBUTES	7	FractionDate	(numeric) Alternative formatting of the event date, computed as YYYY.FFFF, where FFFF is the percentage of the year completed by that day. This collapses the month and day into a fractional range from 0 to 0.9999, capturing the 365 days of the year. The fractional component (FFFF) is computed as (MONTH * 30 + DAY) / 365. This is an approximation and does not correctly take into account the differing numbers of days in each month or leap years, but offers a simple single-number sorting mechanism for applications that wish to estimate the rough temporal distance between dates.	np.float64
a1_	a1_code	actor1	code	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	8	Actor1Code	(character or factor) The complete raw CAMEO code for Actor1 (includes geographic, class, ethnic, religious, and type classes). May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1.. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_name	a1_name	actor1	name	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	9	Actor1Name	(character) The actual name of the Actor 1. In the case of a political leader or organization, this will be the leader’s formal name (GEORGE W BUSH, UNITED NATIONS), for a geographic match it will be either the country or capital/major city name (UNITED STATES / PARIS), and for ethnic, religious, and type matches it will reflect the root match class (KURD, CATHOLIC, POLICE OFFICER, etc). May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1.. 	np.dtype((str, 255))
a1_country	a1_countrycode	actor1	countrycode	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	10	Actor1CountryCode	(character or factor) The 3-character CAMEO code for the country affiliation of Actor1. May be blank if the system was unable to identify an Actor1 or determine its country affiliation (such as “UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN”). Note that through 8/26/2013 matches for South Sudan (“SSD”) may be missing from this field. The country code will be correctly present in the raw CAMEO code in Actor1Code, but may not have been correctly placed into the Actor1CountryCode field – only South Sudan was affected by this issue.	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_knowngroup	a1_knowngroupcode	actor1	knowngroupcode	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	11	Actor1KnownGroupCode	(character or factor) If Actor1 is a known IGO/NGO/rebel organization (United Nations, World Bank, al-Qaeda, etc) with its own CAMEO code, this field will contain that code.. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_ethnic	a1_ethniccode	actor1	ethniccode	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	12	Actor1EthnicCode	(character or factor) If the source document specifies the ethnic affiliation of Actor1 and that ethnic group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here. NOTE: a few special groups like ARAB may also have entries in the type column due to legacy CAMEO behavior. this behavior is brand-new and highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly.. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_religion1	a1_religion1code	actor1	religion1code	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	13	Actor1Religion1Code	(character or factor) If the source document specifies the religious affiliation of Actor1 and that religious group has a CAMEO entry, the CAMEO code is entered here. NOTE: a few special groups like JEW may also have entries in the geographic or type columns due to legacy CAMEO behavior. this behavior is brand-new and highly experimental and may not capture all affiliations properly.	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_religion2	a1_religion2code	actor1	religion2code	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	14	Actor1Religion2Code	(character or factor) If multiple religious codes are specified for Actor1, this contains the secondary code. Some religion entries automatically use two codes, such as Catholic, which invokes Christianity as Code1 and Catholicism as Code2.. 	np.dtype((str, 255))
a1_type1	a1_type1code	actor1	type1code	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	15	Actor1Type1Code	(character or factor) The 3-character CAMEO code of the CAMEO “type” or “role” of Actor1, if specified. This can be a specific role such as Police Forces, Government, Military, Political Opposition, Rebels, etc, a broad role class such as Education, Elites, Media, Refugees, or organizational classes like Non-Governmental Movement. Special codes such as Moderate and Radical may refer to the operational strategy of a group.	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_type2	a1_type2code	actor1	type2code	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	16	Actor1Type2Code	(character or factor) If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this returns the second code.	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_type3	a1_type3code	actor1	type3code	ACTOR ATTRIBUTES	17	Actor1Type3Code	(character or factor) If multiple type/role codes are specified for Actor1, this returns the third code.. (logical or binary or byte) The system codes every event found in an entire document, using an array of techniques to deference and link information together. A number of previous projects such as the ICEWS initiative have found that events occurring in the lead paragraph of a document tend to be the most “important.” This flag can therefore be used as a proxy for the rough importance of an event to create subsets of the event stream.. 	np.dtype((str, 16))

ac_isrootevent	ac_isrootevent	action	isrootevent	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	28	IsRootEvent	(logical or binary or byte) The system codes every event found in an entire document, using an array of techniques to deference and link information together. A number of previous projects such as the ICEWS initiative have found that events occurring in the lead paragraph of a document tend to be the most “important.” This flag can therefore be used as a proxy for the rough importance of an event to create subsets of the event stream.. 	np.int32
ac_event	ac_eventcode	action	eventcode	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	29	EventCode	(character or factor) This is the raw CAMEO action code describing the action that Actor1 performed upon Actor2.. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
ac_eventbase	ac_eventbasecode	action	eventbasecode	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	30	EventBaseCode	(character or factor) CAMEO event codes are defined in a three-level taxonomy. For events at level three in the taxonomy, this yields its level two leaf root node. For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) would yield an EventBaseCode of “025” (“Appeal to yield”). This makes it possible to aggregate events at. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
ac_eventroot	ac_eventrootcode	action	eventrootcode	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	31	EventRootCode	(character or factor) Similar to EventBaseCode, this defines the root-level category the event code falls under. For example, code “0251” (“Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions”) has a root code of “02” (“Appeal”). This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity. For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode.	np.dtype((str, 16))
ac_quadclass	ac_quadclass	action	quadclass	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	32	QuadClass	(integer) The entire CAMEO event taxonomy is ultimately organized under four primary classifications: Verbal Cooperation, Material Cooperation, Verbal Conflict, and Material Conflict. This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the highest level of aggregation. The numeric codes in this field map to the Quad Classes as follows: 1=Verbal Cooperation, 2=Material Cooperation, 3=Verbal Conflict, 4=Material Conflict.	np.int32
ac_goldsteinscale	ac_goldsteinscale	action	goldsteinscale	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	33	GoldsteinScale	(numeric) Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to +10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a country. This is known as the Goldstein Scale. This field specifies the Goldstein score for each event type. this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event record being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both receive the same Goldstein score. This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to yield an approximation of the stability of a location over time.	np.int32
ac_nummentions	ac_nummentions	action	nummentions	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	34	NumMentions	(integer) This is the total number of mentions of this event across all source documents. Multiple references to an event within a single document also contribute to this count. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of source documents and the density of events within them vary over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest. NOTE: this field is updated over time if news articles published later discuss this event (for example, in the weeks after a major bombing there will likely be numerous news articles published mentioning the original bombing as context to new developments, while on the one-year anniversary there will likely be further coverage). At this time the daily event stream only includes new event records found each day and does not include these updates; a special “updates” stream will be released in Fall 2013 that will include these.. 	np.int32
ac_numsources	ac_numsources	action	numsources	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	35	NumSources	(integer) This is the total number of information sources containing one or more mentions of this event. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of sources varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest. NOTE: same as with NumMentions, this field is updated over time to reflect subsequent coverage of the event. Similarly, these updates are not included in the daily event stream, but will be incorporated into a new “updates” stream to be released in Fall 2013.	np.int32
ac_numarticles	ac_numarticles	action	numarticles	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	36	NumArticles	(integer) This is the total number of source documents containing one or more mentions of this event. This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant. The total universe of source documents varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest. NOTE: same as with NumMentions, this field is updated over time to reflect subsequent coverage of the event, but these updates are not currently part of the daily event stream.	np.int32
ac_avgtone	ac_avgtone	action	avgtone	EVENT ACTION ATTRIBUTES	37	AvgTone	(numeric) This is the average “tone”  of all documents containing one or more mentions of this event. The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive). Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral. This can be used as a method of filtering the “context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the “impact” of that event. For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence. A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).. 	np.int32
a1_geo_type	a1_geo_type	actor1	geo_type	EVENT GEOGRAPHY	38	Actor1Geo_Type	(integer) This field specifies the geographic resolution of the match type and holds one of the following values: 1=COUNTRY (match was at the country level), 2=USSTATE (match was to a US state), 3=USCITY (match was to a US city or landmark), 4=WORLDCITY (match was to a city or landmark outside the US), 5=WORLDSTATE (match was to an Administrative Division 1 outside the US – roughly equivalent to a US state). This can be used to filter events by geographic specificity, for example, extracting only those events with a landmark-level geographic resolution for mapping. Note that matches with codes 1 (COUNTRY), 2 (USSTATE), and 5 (WORLDSTATE) will still provide a latitude/longitude pair, which will be the centroid of that country or state, but the FeatureID field below will be blank.. 	np.int32
a1_geo_fullname	a1_geo_fullname	actor1	geo_fullname	EVENT GEOGRAPHY	39	Actor1Geo_Fullname	(character) This is the full human-readable name of the matched location. In the case of a country it is simply the country name. For US and World states it is in the format of “State, Country Name”, while for all other matches it is in the format of “City/Landmark, State, Country”. This can be used to label locations when placing events on a map. NOTE: this field reflects the precise name used to refer to the location in the text itself, meaning it may contain multiple spellings of the same location – use the FeatureID column to determine whether two location names refer to the same place.. 	np.dtype((str, 255))
a1_geo_country	a1_geo_countrycode	actor1	geo_countrycode	EVENT GEOGRAPHY	40	Actor1Geo_CountryCode	(character) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code for the location.. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_geo_adm1	a1_geo_adm1code	actor1	geo_adm1code	EVENT GEOGRAPHY	41	Actor1Geo_ADM1Code	(character) This is the 2-character FIPS10-4 country code followed by the 2-character FIPS10-4 administrative division 1 (ADM1) code for the administrative division housing the landmark. In the case of the United States, this is the 2-character shortform of the state’s name (such as “TX” for Texas).. 	np.dtype((str, 16))
a1_geo_lat	a1_geo_lat	actor1	geo_lat	EVENT GEOGRAPHY	42	Actor1Geo_Lat	(numeric) This is the centroid latitude of the landmark for mapping.. 	np.float32

a1_geo_featureid	a1_geo_featureid	actor1	geo_featureid	EVENT GEOGRAPHY	44	Actor1Geo_FeatureID	(signed integer) This is the GNS or GNIS FeatureID for this location. More information on these values can be found in Leetaru (2012). This field will be blank except when Actor1Geo_Type has a value of 3 or 4. A small percentage of small cities and towns may have a blank value in this field even for Actor1Geo_Type values of 3 or 4: this will be corrected in the 2.0 release of GDELT.
